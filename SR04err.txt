When the arduino IDE complains that sr04.h is missing,
acquire the library from https://github.com/mrRobot62/Arduino-ultrasonic-SR04-library .
Download the "Arduino-ultrasonic-SR04-library-master.zip" file via Clone/Download button.
Open up the Arduino IDE and go to "Sketch -> Include Library -> Add .ZIP Library..."
and go to your downloaded file and choose " Open".
